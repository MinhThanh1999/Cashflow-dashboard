- Provide managers with an overview of the company’s service performance by revenue, showing how many brands we collaborate with. In addition, the total number of brands generating negative revenue and their names can be easily identified.
- Additionally, we can compare forecasted figures with actual amounts to better estimate cash flow, allowing for more accurate budgeting and improved financial control.
