# Cashflow-dashboard
## Objective
- Define the cash flow statement so stakeholders and managers can take action when needed and quickly identify the root cause.
- Help track business growth and identify which brand’s performance is not performing well.
### Dashboard

- Provide managers with an overview of the company’s service performance by revenue, showing how many brands we collaborate with. In addition, the total number of brands generating negative revenue and their names can be easily identified.
- Additionally, we can compare forecasted figures with actual amounts to better estimate cash flow, allowing for more accurate budgeting and improved financial control.

- This sheet provides a deeper view of operational status by separating cash inflows and outflows, allowing us to identify where money is coming in and going out, either across all brands or for an individual brand.
- A Waterfall chart is used to quickly capture fluctuations in sub-nature categories within each brand.
- I have also implemented a **'Drill-through'** function for each sub-nature. This allows managers to investigate any identified anomalies by reviewing the total invoiced amount and tracking pending payments, categorized by Actual vs. Forecast types as shown in the image below.

- Additionally, per management's request, I have included a comparison table providing a line-by-line analysis of non-cumulative cash flow, comparing Actual vs. Forecast by week.

- Next, I will present the cash flow trends (Actual vs. Forecast). This allows management to evaluate brand performance and decide whether to continue the collaboration, implement improvement plans, or terminate services for underperforming brands.
